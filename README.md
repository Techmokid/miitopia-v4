This is Miitopia, the discord bot!!

This is version 4, written in python instead of javascript, so it's automatically better IMHO.

This discord bot uses FFMPEG terminal commands to place music from the Nintendo game "Miitopia" on top of images you post in the discord. I've also tried to make it somewhat human-feeling in it's random responses, simply to give it some life!

To run this bot, make sure you have FFMPEG installed on your device (Open terminal and type "ffmpeg" to see if it is), and make sure in your OS's environment variables there is a variable called "MIITOPIA_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN" that contains the discord token for your chosen account. This is how I've gotten around me accidentally sharing my discord token online publically lol

All music it chooses is pulled from the local "music" folder, which I've already included all of the music files from Miitopia. You can also put custom music in there as well if you wish!

To run this bot, simply run "miitopiaV4.py" and after a few seconds it should be online
